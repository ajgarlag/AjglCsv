        PEAR standard exists inside the PHP_CodeSniffer install

    <!--
        Some sniffs have public member vars that allow you to
        customise specific elements of the sniff. In the case of
        the Generic LineLength sniff, you can customise the limit
        at which the sniff will throw warnings and the limit at
        which it will throw errors.

        The rule below includes the LineLength sniff but changes the
        settings so the sniff will show warnings for any line longer
        than 90 chars and errors for any line longer than 100 chars.
